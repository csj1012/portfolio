            <h3>Humble beginnings...</h3>
            <p>I created my first website in 2001 when I was 11 years old. It was a Pok√©mon RPG. I used the tools available to me (MS Paint and the ability to google "HTML Tables") and the rest was history!</p>
            <p>I'm lucky to have worked with some fantastic people. Projects that I've been part of have been featured in Drupal.org case studies and Midcamp talks.</p>
            <h3>Dancing!</h3>
            <p>I danced ballet growing up and returned to the art as an adult. I enjoy staging, choreographing, and teaching (particularly beginner ballet!)</p>
            <h3>Knitting!</h3>
            <p>Knitting is a new hobby for me! It's basically guaranteed that any moment my hands are idle, they are holding a pair of knitting needles.</p>
            <h3>My cat!</h3>
            <p>I have a pet cat, Maurice. Maurice is five years old. He knows a few tricks (sit and shake!), loves to play fetch, and is a serious cuddle monster.</p>
            <h3>Honorable mention</h3>
            <p>I'm also:
            <ul>
              <li>A gamer (talk to me about Zelda. Or Skyrim. Or Minecraft, or Subnautica. Or The Sims for that matter.)</li>
              <li>A creative writer (NaNoWriMo fails: 17)</li>
              <li>A singer (I love singing in a cappella groups especially)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>
      );
    }
  };
